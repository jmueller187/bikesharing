# bikesharing
Data visualization with Tableau.

## Overview of Project:
The task for this project was to analyze Citi Bike bikesharing data compiled in New York City for the month of August, 2019 to determine how a bike share business functions in New York. Once the data was analyzed, we used Tableau Worksheets, Dashboards and Stories to create a business proposal of how a similar business might work in Des Moines, IA for presenting to our potential angel investors.

## Results:
The final proposal can be viewed here:

Here are what our graphed results revealed:
1) Rider Breakdown showed there were 1,900,359 subscribers and 443,865 customers who use the service on a per-ride basis.
2) Gender Breakdown resulted in 1,530,272 male users, 588,431 female users and 225,521 unknown users.

3) From our Checkout Times for Users line graph, we saw that the trip duration for a majority of the rides was 60 minutes or less. The most frequent trip time ended up being 5 minutes, with over 146,000 rides.

4) The Checkout Times by Gender line graph indicated that males were the larger majority of bike users during the month of August, taking up to 3 times as many females.

5) From the Trips by Weekday per Hour heat map, we saw that the highest number of weekday rides occurred between 7 AM and 9 AM in the morning and again between 5 PM and 7 PM in the evening. The weekend results showed most rides occurred between 9 AM and 7 PM.

6) The Trps by Gender (Weekday per Hour) heat map mirrored the results seen on the Checkout Times by Gender and Trips by Weekday per Hour graphs. Specifically:
    a) Males were the most frequest bike users.
    b) The highest number of weekday rides occured between typical commuting hours of 7 AM - 9 AM and 5 PM - 7 PM.
    c) Rides on the weekends were concentrated between 9 AM - 7 PM.

7) From the User Trips by Gender (per Weekday) heat map, we saw the following:
    a) Thursday was most popular day that male and female subscribers used a bike, followed by Friday, Tuesday and Monday respectively.
    b) Bikes rented by customers not subscribing to the service were fairly consistent throught the entire week, with an increase in rides occurring on Saturdays and Sundays.

## Summary:
By analyzing this data set were were able to gather and generate many data visualizations, including rider and gender breakdowns, peak hours of operation, top starting and ending points, trip durations, and number of trips occurring per each day of the week, gender and subscriber/single-use customer.
Included below are two additional visualizations performed on the Citi Bike data set:
1) Visualization for the top 10 starting and ending station locations for bike trips:

3) Visualization for usage per Bikeid and ideal maintenance time.
